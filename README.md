This repository contains various scripts used when preprocessing data at different stages of the MEX project.

## IMPORTANT

Note that these scripts do not contain production-ready, polished code, and they were not intended to be used outside of the context of the MEX/Codebook project. They depend on multiple interim files and require a specific arrangement of the source files; thus, we do not guarantee that the code will be functional on its own.

Yet, we consider this repo a useful reference to showcase the pipelines and preprocessing strategies used when assembling MEX and curating the underlying data.

In case of particular questions, please contact Ilya Vorontsov (@VorontsovIE, vorontsov.i.e@gmail.com).

Please refer to the MEX manuscript [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.11.622097v1] and MEX Zenodo repo [https://zenodo.org/records/15667805] for polished production-ready data and a detailed description of the underlying procedures.
