Sheet	Description
TF Genes	"A table describing general properties of the 336 + 26 proteins that are the subject of the study, retrieved from the ""HumanTFs"" page (http://humantfs.ccbr.utoronto.ca).  336 proteins were selected as (a) being a ""likely TF"" in Lambert 2018; (b) lacking a motif in Lambert 2018, and (c) not having been previously analyzed by the Hughes lab.  An additional 26 were selected as controls also added to the study; these correspond to proteins with high-quality SMiLE-seq data from Isakova 2017, and that contain a variety of DNA-binding domains."
Inserts	"A table listing the 626 distinct gene synthesis inserts used in this study.  Each of the 336 TFs was synthesized as a full-length insert (""FL"") (338 inserts; two were synthesized as duplicates), and one or more inserts containing only the DNA-binding domain(s) (""DBD"") (289 inserts), except in a minority of cases where the FL protein was extremely long, or the DNA-binding domain(s) were unknown.  This table also indicates which plasmid backbones the insert has been cloned into."
Plasmids	A table listing the xxx distinct plasmids employed in this study.  Three main plasmid backbones are used:  pTHXXXXX (a T7-driven GST fusion vector for IVT or expression in E. coli, used in PBMs, HT-SELEX, and AffiSeq), Pf3a_Enz_Res_egfp (an SP6-driven eGFP fusion vector for IVT or expression in E. coli, used mainly for SMiLE-seq), and pTH13195 (a TetO7-driven eGFP fusion vector for expression in cultured cells, used for ChIP-seq, HT-SELEX, and AffiSeq).  This table also indicates which proteins have been analyzed in which assays.
PBM experiments	A table listing the PBM experiments performed, with a separate row for each array.
HT-SELEX experiments	A table listing the HT-SELEX experiments, with a separate row for each well position.
AffiSeq experiments	A table listing the AffiSeq experiments, with a separate row for each well position.
SMiLE-seq experiments	A table listing the SMiLE-seq experiments, with a separate row for each assay.
ChIP-seq experiments	A table listing the ChIP-seq experiments, with a separate row for each ChIP experiment.
