Sheet	Description
TF Genes	A table describing general properties of the 336 + 26 + 31 = 393 proteins that are the subject of the study, retrieved from the "HumanTFs" page (http://humantfs.ccbr.utoronto.ca).  336 proteins ("Codebook clones") were selected as (a) being a "likely TF" in Lambert 2018; (b) lacking a motif in Lambert 2018, and (c) not having been previously analyzed by the Hughes lab.  An additional 26 ("SMILE-seq controls") were selected as controls added to the study; these correspond to proteins with high-quality SMiLE-seq data from Isakova 2017, and that represent a variety of DNA-binding domain types (i.e. diverse structural classes).  A further 31 ("Schmitges controls") are included that correspond to C2H2-ZF TFs yielding clear motifs by ChIP-seq in Schmitges 2016, which were used in pilot experiments for SELEX and Affiseq.  Note that CTCF and YY1 are used as process controls for ChIP-seq using cell lines derived independently of this project.
Inserts	A table listing the 715 distinct gene synthesis inserts contained in the "Codebook clone" collection, as well as the insert sequences of the "SMILE-seq" and "Schmitges" controls.  Each of the 336 "Codebook" TFs was synthesized as a full-length insert ("FL") (338 inserts; two were synthesized as duplicates), and one or more inserts containing only the DNA-binding domain(s) ("DBD") (289 inserts), except in a minority of cases where the FL protein was extremely long, or the DNA-binding domain(s) were unknown.  This table also indicates which plasmid backbones the insert has been cloned into.
Plasmids	A table listing the xxx distinct plasmids employed in this study.  Three main plasmid backbones are used:  pTHXXXXX (a T7-driven GST fusion vector for IVT or expression in E. coli, used in PBMs, HT-SELEX, and AffiSeq), Pf3a_Enz_Res_egfp (an SP6-driven eGFP fusion vector for IVT or expression in E. coli, used mainly for SMiLE-seq), and pTH13195 (a TetO7-driven eGFP fusion vector for expression in cultured cells, used for ChIP-seq, HT-SELEX, and AffiSeq).  This table also indicates which proteins have been analyzed in which assays.
PBM experiments	A table listing the PBM experiments performed, with a separate row for each array.
HT-SELEX experiments	A table listing the HT-SELEX experiments, with a separate row for each well position.
AffiSeq experiments	A table listing the AffiSeq experiments, with a separate row for each well position.
SMiLE-seq experiments	A table listing the SMiLE-seq experiments, with a separate row for each assay.
ChIP-seq experiments	A table listing the ChIP-seq experiments, with a separate row for each ChIP experiment.
