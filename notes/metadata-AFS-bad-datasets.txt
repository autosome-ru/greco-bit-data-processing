I took a look at the motifs and our own datafiles.
 

”YWD_B_AffSeq_C01_ZNF428   DNTTIP1”

Experiment only enriches NFI-artifact, whereas there are other experiments that produce consistent signals. Earlier files all say that this should be ZNF428 and I couldn’t find a reason for it changing to DNTTIP1. Maybe Ally can find an explanation for this, but if she can’t we should just drop it.

” YWD_B_AffSeq_F07_RFX5     TSC22D1”

This has a strong signal that is definitely really the RFX5, because the motifs are perfect match for RFX-sites in both the HT and GHT SELEX experiments (that must be based on the same lysate, because there is only one of them).

“YWD_B_AffSeq_G09_ZNF165   ZBTB41”.

ZNF165 is located next to the ZBTB41 on the same plate, one of them is F9 and the other one G9, and thus this is some kind of primate-mediated mix-up and it is hard to say at what level (I didn’t find any note about clones being replaced, etc). ZNF165 does not belong to the Codebook dataset and the signal only has Alu and NFI artifacts.  – I say that we should flush it out of the dataset.

 

”YWE_B_AffSeq_E02_TRAFD1   ZBTB41”

It is hard to say where this mix-up is derived from because there shouldn’t be ZBTB41 in the batch, this file has also some real looking enrichment in it, so it would be worth to keep around.. Maybe Ally can find an explanation for this.
