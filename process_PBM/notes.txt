## Notes

In general, both PBM designs consistently yielded similar motifs.
However, the overall correlation with the PBM signal does not seem to be informative, 
making it impossible to judge if the results are adequate w/o external validation. 
We will now switch to preparing the ChIP-Seq data for training/validation.

## Issues

There are two minor issues with the metadata of the initial PBM data:
(1) ID mismatch in the CHAMP1 data: "RawData/R_2018-08-30_13565_1M-ME_Standard_pTH13957.1_CHAMP1.DBD.txt"
Two non-identical IDS are listed in annotation: 13957 (incorrect) and 13565 (correct).

(2) `R_2018-11-28_13975_1M-HK_Standard_pTH13931.3_ZBED4` has probe indexing different from that of the other 1M-HK probes:
cells with the same `id_probe` have `row` numbers either +1 or -1, `id_spot` differ by +85 or -85. Is it OK?

## Questions

There were some fields in PBM chip data which we cannot interpret undoubtedly. Can use please describe them?
1) `Flag` field. We treat it as an indicator that some quality check for source data failed, is it correct?
2) `Id_probe` field contains names like `MEforward06526`. Does that name mean how the sequence was joined to a linker? 
We didn't consider this orientation in our pipeline (it could influence numbers in PWMBench-PBM correlation estimates), should we?
